# __Challenge__

# Write a Python program to display only those numbers from a
# list that satisfy the following conditions.

# __Conditions__

# The number must be divisible by five
# If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the following number
# If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

for i in numbers:
    if i % 5 == 0 and i <= 150:
        print(i)
    elif i > 500:
        break
