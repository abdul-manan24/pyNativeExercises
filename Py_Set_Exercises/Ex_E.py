# __Challenge__

# Find the symmetric difference of set1 and set2.
# Write a code to returns a new set containing
# elements that are unique to either set1 or set2,
# but not in both. It’s like finding the union and
# then removing the intersection.

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}

print(f"Symmetric difference: {set1 ^ set2}")
print(f"Symmetric difference: {set1.symmetric_difference(set2)}")
